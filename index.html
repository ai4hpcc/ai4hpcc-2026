  <h1>AI for High Performance Compiler Construction (AI4HPCC)</h1>
  <p>Workshop on AI-enhanced compiler technologies for HPC systems</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 12px; font-size: 14px; opacity: 0.9;">
    Co-located with the ACM International Conference on Supercomputing 2026 (ICS'26),
    6 July 2026, Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    The <em>AI4HPCC</em> workshop explores the rapidly growing intersection between
    artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance compiler construction,
    focusing on how large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning, and other 
    AI-driven methods can revolutionize the way we design, optimize, and deploy 
    compilers for modern and emerging computing architectures, in both academic 
    research and industrial practice.
  </p>

  <p>
   As high-performance computing systems evolve to include heterogeneous processors, 
    accelerators, advanced memory hierarchies, and novel interconnects, compiler design 
    faces unprecedented complexity. Traditional heuristic-based optimization approaches 
    struggle to keep pace with the increasing diversity of architectures and programming 
    models. *AI4HPCC* aims to address these challenges by fostering discussion on 
    AI-enhanced techniques that can automate, generalize, and accelerate the compiler 
    optimization pipeline — from code analysis and transformation to performance modeling 
    and autotuning.
  </p>
